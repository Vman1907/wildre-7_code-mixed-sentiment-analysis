# Summary:
The [Code-mixed Less-Resourced Sentiment analysis (Code-mixed) Shared Task](https://github.com/wildre-workshop/wildre-7_code-mixed-sentiment-analysis/) is a part of the [7th Workshop on Indian Language Data: Resources and Evaluation (WILDRE-7)](http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/conf/wildre7/index.jsp).
# Introduction: 
<p align="justify">This shared task addresses the complexities of code-mixed data from less-resourced similar languages and focuses on sentiment analysis. The task builds on code-mixed sentiment analysis but introduces language pairs and triplets of less-resourced closely related languages, Magahi-Hindi-English, Maithili-Hindi, Bangla-English, and Hindi-English. These four languages come from the Indo-Aryan language family and are spoken in eastern India.
Keeping a record of the challenges of processing closely related languages in code-mixed and low-resourced settings. We challenge the participants to explore using different Machine learning and Deep learning approaches to train the model on the given training and validation dataset while testing on a surprise language. In this context, we will provide Hindi-English, Bangla-English and Magahi-Hindi-English datasets for training and validation. However, the Maithili-Hindi dataset will be provided as a surprise language pair to the test sets. This task will allow the participants to use any approach to train their model but robust enough to perform on a closely related language dataset. This would also allow us to understand the language representation in various code-mixed settings and the preference of the language by the speakers to express their emotions in each language pair. </p>
